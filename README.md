# Application Development using Java J2SE and JavaFX UI Controls

## **Purpose:**

Using **Java and JavaFX UI Controls**, develop a Travel Reservation System .
The system should be able to provide the following:
- Accept travel related information.
- Display a ticket based on the travel reservation details.

## **Outcomes:**
1. Apply the object-oriented programming techniques of Java.
2. Write decision-making statements and control structures to solve problems.
3. Create user-friendly interfaces by applying the various techniques of Java.
4. Explore best practices for designing and developing applications.


**Problem statement:**

An airline company that runs domestic flights has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You have been asked to design the logo and develop the new system.

Each flight has a flight number, source, destination and flight fare.

Every passenger is identified by the first name, last name and age.
The airline has passengers flying as frequent flyers. The frequent flyer passenger is identified by the frequent flyer number and collects miles.

The travel date is also required.

The travel reservations details must contain the flight details, date of travel, frequent flyer passenger details.
It should calculate the total fare payable based on the flight fare and taxes.

- Flight number
- Source
- Destination
- Date of travel
- Passenger’s first name and last name
- Passenger’s age
- Frequent flyer number
- Total Miles
